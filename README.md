# Olu Kareem • Full‑Stack Web & Mobile Engineer

I build polished, production‑grade apps with **React / Next.js** on the web and **Flutter** on mobile.

## What you’ll find in this repo

| Folder | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| **/app** | Next.js 13 routes (portfolio site) |
| **/components** | Re‑usable UI built with Tailwind + Shadcn |
| **/lib** | Convex DB helpers, OpenAI utilities, SES mailer |
| **/public** | Static assets & OG images |

The live site is automatically deployed to Vercel on every push—so the code you see here is exactly what runs in production.

## Core skills

`React` • `Next.js` • `TypeScript` • `Flutter` • `Node.js`  
`Convex / Mongo / SQL` • `Firebase & Analytics` • `AWS SES`  
`OpenAI / LangChain` for AI‑powered features

I’m comfortable owning the full lifecycle—from Figma hand‑off to CI/CD and post‑launch iterations.
